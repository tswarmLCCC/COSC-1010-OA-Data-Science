Assignment: Conference Attendee Analysis

You have been given a CSV file named `attendees.csv` that contains a list of
people attending a conference. The file has two columns: 'name' and 'age'.

Your task is to write a Python script that reads this file and calculates the
average age of the attendees.

**A file named `attendees.csv` must be in the same directory with this content:**
name,age
Alice,29
Bob,41
Charlie,35
David,22
Eve,38

Instructions:
1.  Import the pandas library.
2.  Use pandas to read the `attendees.csv` file into a DataFrame.
3.  Select the 'age' column from the DataFrame.
4.  Use the appropriate pandas method to calculate the mean (average) of the ages.
5.  Print the result in a user-friendly message, for example:
    "The average age of attendees is: 33.0"
